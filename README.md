When creating R markdown websites, I often find myself wanting to
organise content into a nice-looking grid of links. The goal of bs4cards
is to his task a little easier inside an R markdown document or website.
You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
