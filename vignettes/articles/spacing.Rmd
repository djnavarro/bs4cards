title: "Spacing"

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
library(tibble)
```

```{r setup}
library(bs4cards)
```


To modify the separation between cards, use the `spacing` argument. Currently this argument is numeric, and takes a number between 0 and 5. At `spacing = 0`, all spacing between cards is removed:

```{r, message=FALSE}
cards(data = galleries[1:6, ], image = image_url, spacing = 0)
```

At `spacing = 5` there is a lot of room between cards:

```{r, message=FALSE}
cards(data = galleries[1:6, ], image = image_url, spacing = 5)
```
