## Card width

There are four pre-specified width settings, numbered from 1 to 5. All are responsive widths, and will resize the cards and change the number of columns depending on the size of the display device. To provide a sense of how each setting behaves, try resizing the window and seeing how these cards behave:

```{r, results='hold', message=FALSE}
cards(data = galleries[1,], image = image_url, width = 1)
cards(data = galleries[1,], image = image_url, width = 2)
cards(data = galleries[1,], image = image_url, width = 3)
cards(data = galleries[1,], image = image_url, width = 4)
cards(data = galleries[1,], image = image_url, width = 5)
```
