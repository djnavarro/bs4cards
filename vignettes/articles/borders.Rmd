```

The colour and width of card borders are customisable, as is the amount of rounding on the card borders. 

## Border width

To remove the borders entirely set `border_width = 0`:

```{r}
galleries[1:3, ] %>% 
  cards(
    title = long_name,
    image = image_url, 
    border_width = 0
  )
```

For thick borders, set `border_width = 5`:

```{r}
galleries[1:3, ] %>% 
  cards(
    title = long_name,
    image = image_url, 
    border_width = 5
  )
```


## Border colour

By default the `border_colour` argument is set to `NULL`, and is interpreted as a CSS value of `"inherit"`. However, you can override this and set the card label colour manually. The `border_colour` argument will accept any valid colour string recognised by R. The input can either be a single colour or a vector assigning each card a different border colour:

```{r}
galleries[1:3, ] %>% 
  cards(
    title = long_name,
    image = image_url, 
    border_width = 2,
    border_colour = c("#8b0000", "black", "#0b0b80")
  )
```


## Border radius

The `border_radius` argument is used to control the degree of rounding of the card borders, and should be an integer between 0 and 5. At `border_radius = 0` the cards are perfectly rectangular, with no rounding at all:

```{r}
galleries[1:3, ] %>% 
  cards(
    title = long_name,
    image = image_url, 
    border_radius = 0,
  )
```

At the roundest setting `border_radius = 5` produces noticeably rounded rectangles:

```{r}
galleries[1:3, ] %>% 
  cards(
    title = long_name,
    image = image_url, 
    border_radius = 5,
  )
```


## Additional customisation

Additional border customisation is possible, by passing character strings for `border_width` and `border_width`. When character input is used, the `cards()` function passes the input directly to the CSS. For example, you can create cards with circular images and very thick borders like this:

```{r}
galleries[1:3, ] %>% 
  cards(
    image = image_url, 
    border_colour = "#dddddd",
    border_width = "20px",
    border_radius = "20rem",
  )
```
