# bs4cards 0.1.1

* Updates maintainer email address
* Automatically detect data columns that match argument names (thanks @gadenbuie #41)
* Fixed an internal error when tags and labels aren't used with the cards
  (thanks @sciencificity #31, @gadenbuie #38).
* `label_colour` and `border_colour` now default to NULL (inherit from parent)
* Added bslib as a suggested package (thanks @jsta #32)
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
