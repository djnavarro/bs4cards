When creating R markdown websites, I often find myself wanting to organise content into a nice-looking grid of links. The goal of bs4cards is to his task a little easier inside an R markdown document or website. You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("djnavarro/bs4cards")
```
